# Todolist

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.

## About The Project
This project was made to reforce my knowledges of Angular. It's a todo list with drag-and-drop elements, dark mode and using localStorage as a "database".

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## User Interface Credits
I'm not the one who created the UI, my only job was to bring it into code. All credits goes to [itcenter uchquduq](https://www.figma.com/@b1198297_e3c1_4?fuid=719356203518788029) on Figma.
